==================Spring Boot Actuator Tutorial ==========================
1. To add Actuator Dependency to your spring boot application, Add
			<!-- Actuator Dependency -->
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
		</dependency>
	
	For easy Browsing, You can add HAL browser dependency as well
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-data-rest-hal-browser</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		
	For quick developement, I am also using devtools
	
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
			<scope>runtime</scope>
			<optional>true</optional>
		</dependency>
		
		
2. Start the application and hit localhost:8080 (8080 is default port of my application) which will enables HAL browser, Add /actuator under explorer and go, It will list down all the Actuator Endpoints (By default, only the health and info endpoints are exposed over HTTP)
	Check HalBrowser1.PNG under screenshot
	
3. There are many more endpoints which are currently disabled. To enable it, Add below value to application.properties 
		management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
	Restart the application (If you have devtools then it will do it for you ) and hit again HAL browser by hitting localhost:8080
	Check HalBrowser2.PNG under screenshot

4.Now Click on any endpoint, it will show you the details, Ex: We want all the env variable so just click on it and it will display all the env variables
	Check ENV.jpg 
	Similarly, you can check for health, status, metrics and show on
	
5. Some of the useful actuator endpoints are:

	- env: provides information about the Spring Environment properties.
	- health: Shows application health
	- beans: this endpoint returns the list of all the beans configured in our application.
	- info: Displays application information, we can configure this in Spring environment properties.
	- mappings: Displays the list of all @RequestMapping paths.
	- shutdown: allows us to gracefully shutdown the application.
	- threaddump: provides the thread dump of the application.
	
6. If you hit /info then you must have realized that it is not showing any information. Why?  because we have not set any value to Info.
			Check EmptyInfo.jpg file
	To set it, add value to info under application.properties file
		# Set info value
		info.app.name=Spring Actuator Tutorial
		info.app.java.version=8
		info.app.type=Spring Boot application
	Check InfoWithDetails.jpg files
	
7. By default, the health endpoint only shows a  UP or DOWN status. To get the complete details, add the following property in the application.properties file 
		management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
	Check health.jpg file
	HEalth will show you detail of databases as well if you application has any db connection
	
8. We also check for logger level and the best part, you can update it without restarting application which can be really helpful in many situations
	Current log level
		Check logger.jpg file
	To update the logger 
		check updateLogger file to update root level log from INFO to DEBUG
	Check updatedLogger.jpg file to see after logger level updation
	And your will start logging DEBUG level LOG as well 
	
9. Customizing Actuator End Points Base Path
	As we know, By default base-path of actuator endpoints is /actuator, we can change it to any other value by setting management.endpoints.web.base-path in application properties file.
		management.endpoints.web.base-path=/management

10. How to enable new Endpoint (Custom Endpoints )
	if you want to expose some detail of application or any other information detail via actuator endpoint, you can do it by exposing new actutaor Endpoint
		Check class NewActuatorEndpoint to know more about endpoint
		Check NewEndpoint.jpg file after adding to it.
		Check NewEndpointMessage.JPG file to see response
